[33m89528d3[m Add network monitor server and real-time network monitoring features
[33m7c5d1ad[m feat: Admin Dashboard now reads from ALL users that sign up in real-time - Enhanced user listener to monitor ALL users (both admins and regular users) - Added real-time user summary showing total, regular users, and admins - Added role badges to distinguish between admin and user accounts - Implemented real-time signup notifications when new users register - Updated user monitoring section to show all users with their roles - Added automatic bandwidth data fetching for all users (admins included) - Real-time updates show user count changes and new registrations - Admin Dashboard now provides comprehensive monitoring of all system users
[33me7dfc2d[m feat: Remove all hardcoded and simulated data from Admin Dashboard - Replaced simulated bandwidth data generation with real network data - Updated data collection to use real network bandwidth instead of device usage - Removed hardcoded alerts and replaced with real network interface count - Updated charts to show real network data (download/upload/total) - Replaced device usage chart with network interface speed chart - Removed hardcoded user data sync and replaced with real network interfaces display - Updated real-time status to show network monitoring instead of device collection - All data now comes from useRealNetwork hook for consistency with User Dashboard
[33m896983a[m feat: Replace virtual networks with real network interfaces - Removed Firestore virtual networks dependency - Integrated useRealNetwork hook to read actual network interfaces - Updated Index page to show real network interfaces from user's machine - Added network interface details (IP, type, speed, status) - Updated UI text to reflect real network monitoring - Added server status indicators for network monitor - Network selection now shows actual interfaces like User Dashboard
